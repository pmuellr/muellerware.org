<h1>ncSeasMap</h1>

<p>The program linked to below creates a .kml file
suitable for use with Google Earth or Google Maps, 
which contains markers and data for NOAA sea / wave height forecasts
for the coast of North Carolina.  The
.kml file itself is updated every few hours, to keep the
data current.</p>

<p>The weather data is pulled from the NOAA; they provide lots and lots of data, 
so much so that it can be hard to find what you need.  Sea/wave forecasts for
the US are available by drilling down through the
<a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/marine/zone/usamz.htm">Marine Forecasts</a>
site.
