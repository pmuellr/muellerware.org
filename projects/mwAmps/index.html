<h1>mwAmps</h1>
<p>Some Ableton 6.x Racks that serve as cheap-ass guitar amps.
</p>

<p>I'm cheap.  Rather than go buy something like Amplitube or Guitar Rig,
I figure I can get close enough for rock+roll by building some amps
in Ableton itself.  Each amp is a rack, with up to 8 radial controllers
to modify things in the amp.  If you're a cheap-ass like me, enjoy!</p>

<h2>AU Presets for AmpliTube2Live</h2>

<p>I've 'saved' all the presets from AmpliTube2 Live from
within Ableton Live as AU presets for the mac.  The file is available here:</p>

<p><tt><a href="AmpliTube2Live-AU-Presets.zip">AmpliTube2Live-AU-Presets.zip</a></tt></p>

<p>Unzip the file, and then drop the top level directory, 
<tt>AmpliTube2Live</tt> into the directory
<tt>/Users/[username]/Library/Audio/Presets/IK Multimedia/</tt>
</p>
