<h1>ncParksMap</h1>

<p>The program linked to below creates a .kml file
suitable for use with Google Earth or Google Maps, 
which contains markers for the North Carolina Parks,
mainly the North Carolina <b>State</b> Parks,
along with some associated weather information.  The
.kml file itself is updated every few hours, to keep the
weather data current.</p>

<p>For more information on the NC State Parks, please
check out their extensive web site

<p>2007/01/07 - version 0.5<br/>

</ul>

<p>2007/01/05 - version 0.3<br/>
<ul>
<li>Added an empty Snippet to each park, which means that
first bit of the description doesn't show up in Google Earth's
navigator.</li>
<li>Added an icon for the parks; a tree in a yellow circle framed in black.
Only showing up for Google Earth right now, not Google Maps.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>2007/01/04 - version 0.2<br/> 
<ul>
