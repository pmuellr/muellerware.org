<h1>wcll</h1>
<p>A
<a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> 
script to enable looking up books displayed in
Amazon pages, for the Wake County Public Library system (NC).
</p>

<p>I inherited this script from my next-door cube-mate,
<a href="http://joshstaiger.org/projects/wakelibrary/">Josh Staiger</a>,
who no longer lives in Wake County, and so wasn't keeping it up to date.
Lazy ass.</p>

<p>Right click over this link to install the script: <b><a href="wcll.user.js">wcll.user.js</a></b></p>

<p><b>Updates:</b></p>

<p>2007/03/21 - version 0.3; change to the ISBN lookup logic, 
to search on the page if the ISBN seem to be in the URI.  Also
move the output to the top of the page.  I don't really want it
at the top of the page, but am also unwilling to figure out
how to do the right thing.</p>
