<h3>History</h3>
<ul>
<li>2009-07-02 - <a href="http://muellerware.org">Patrick Mueller</a> - initial write-up</li>
</ul>

<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I thought it would be interesting to compare the methods used to display
data in JavaScript debuggers. I surveyed:
<ul> 
<li><a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> 1.4.0b4 on FireFox 3.5 
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/UsingtheWebInspector/UsingtheWebInspector.html">Web Inspector</a> in WebKit nightly r45193
<li><a href="http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/">Dragonfly</a> in Opera 10.00.6477
</ul>

<p>I suppose I should test Internet Explorer as well, but I don't think I have the
requisite tooling installed to use the debugger (if someone wants to contact
me offline about how to set up IE for debugging without having a for-pay
version of Visual Studio installed, please do). 

<p>I also included Eclipse's Java debugger in the survey.

<p>For the test, I constructed an HTML
file with some JavaScript code that created a set of data, and then compared
how this data was displayed in the various debuggers.
    
<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>The Data</h2>

<p>The data used in the tests was constructed as local variables within a function
which was programmatically invoked.  Note, this paper includes a link (below)
to run the test.
    
<p>First a set of basic objects is created:
    
<pre>
    var anInteger        = 42;
    var aFloat           = 6.66;
    var aBoolean         = true;
    var aString          = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,..."; // 180 chars total
    var aNull            = null;
    var anUndefined      = undefined;
    var aNaN             = 1/undefined;
    var anObject         = {x: 5, y: 25};
    var aPrintableObject = {x: 5, y: 25};
    var aMap             = {};
    var anArray          = [];
    var anArguments      = arguments;
    var anElement        = document.getElementById("body_title")    
</pre>

<p>Then, the <code>aMap</code> object has a number of properties added; a
property with the name of each of the variables above is added, with the value
being the variable's value. Then, the <code>anArray</code> object has a number
of elements added; each of the variable's value above is added to the list.
The <code>aPrintableObject</code> object is augmented with a 
<code>toString()</code> method which displays the values of it's properties.

<p>For Java, a method similar to this function is created as a <code>static
main</code> for a class.
    
<p>Note that initial attempts at creating recursive versions of
<code>anArray</code> and <code>aMap</code> by adding those objects to
themselves resulted in "odd behavior" in some browsers and even the Eclipse
debugger.  This should be further investigated, but for the purposes of this
exercise, the immediately recursive structures were not used.

<p>To run the test yourself, bring up the JavaScript debugger for your
browser, and then
<a href="javascript:run()">click here</a>.  Because there is
a <code>debugger</code> statement in the <code>run()</code> function which is 
invoked, you typically won't
need to set a breakpoint to get to the point where all the variables are set,
however, you will likely need to display and/or enable the debugger before 
traversing the link.

<h2>Initial unexpanded variable list</h2>

<p>This is the list of variables that the debugger initially displays when
it hits the breakpoint.

<p>Notes:
    
<ul>
       
<li><p>Firebug's list is unusually larger than the others, looks like it could
set the line height a bit smaller.  

<li><p>This beta release of Firebug is currently printing the object representation
as <b>undefined</b>.  In previous releases, instead of seeing <b>undefined</b>,
you'd see the result of the object's <code>toString()</code> method, or 
the name of the object's constructor.  Presumably this is a bug in the beta
release which will get fixed eventually.

<li><p>In addition to the <code>toString()</code> representation, or class
name, Firebug also displays additional information beside a variable.  
For instance, the <code>this</code> variable shows the base name of the
url the window is diplaying.  For the <code>aMap</code> variable, it shows
some of they key/value pairs in the map.

<li><p>Although it's not shown here, because it's not the default behavior,
Eclipse can be configured to show the <code>toString()</code> representation
of a value instead of the class name and (useless) id value.
    
<li><p>All of the debuggers use trees to display nested structures,
using "disclosure triangle" or "squared plus" glyphs.  Firebug and Eclipse
additionally separate the variables and values, keeping the values left 
aligned to themselves.  We'll see this causes problems later when the nested
structures expand and the values need to be shifted to the right.

<li><p>Dragonfly's "squared plus" glyphs for nested structures align with
non-nested property names.  Messy.

<li><p>Firebug and Dragonfly make use of color and font for different
values.  Firebug also displays some special values in a "reverse video"
style - <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>, but not <code>NaN</code>.

<li><p>Dragonfly makes no attempt at displaying at least the class name
for an object, unlike the other debuggers, it just always displays "object".

<li><p>Web Inspector and Eclipse only display a small amount of the 
string.  Dragonfly displays a bit more, but it spills into a second line,
messily.  Firebug displays the entire line.  Wonder how long of a string
they'll display?
    
<li><p>Firebug shows the <code>anArguments</code> variable as an array,
but no structure, and Web Inspector and Dragonfly show it only as an object.
Having both would be nice, in terms of being able to view it as an array,
but also see the properties if expanded.

</ul>

<p>Though it's not displayed, expanding the <code>aMap</code> variable
results in a sublist for each of the debuggers which is similar to this
list itself.  For Eclipse, well, let's not go there.

<div class="figure">Firebug       <p><img src="fb-01.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Web Inspector <p><img src="wi-01.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Dragonfly     <p><img src="df-01.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Eclipse       <p><img src="ej-01.png"></div>
    
<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>aPrintableObject expanded</h2>

<p>In this set of images, we see the <code>aPrintableObject</code>
expanded.

<ul>
    
<li><p>Firebug does not display the <code>toString()</code> method,
Web Inspector only shows the first line of the function (pretty useless), and 
Dragonfly shows it as an object.

<li><p>Worth nothing again that Firebug would typically display the
result of the <code>toString</code> invocation beside the 
<code>aPrintableObject</code> variable, but doesn't for this beta release,
incorrectly showing <b>undefined</b> instead.

<li><p>We show the additional area below the variable list for
Eclipse in this image.  In this case, we see the <code>toString()</code>
representation.  And again, Eclipse can be configured to show this in the
variable display, but it's not the default.

</ul>

<div class="figure">Firebug       <p><img src="fb-02.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Web Inspector <p><img src="wi-02.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Dragonfly     <p><img src="df-02.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Eclipse       <p><img src="ej-02.png"></div>
    
<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>anArray expanded</h2>

<p>In this set of images, we see the <code>anArray</code>
variable expanded.  No big surprises based on anything we've so far.
Except that Web Inspector appears to be sorting the key names
alphabetically, which is confusing.

<div class="figure">Firebug       <p><img src="fb-03.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Web Inspector <p><img src="wi-03.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Dragonfly     <p><img src="df-03.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Eclipse       <p><img src="ej-03.png"></div>
    
<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>anElement expanded</h2>

<p>The main point in showing this set of images is to demonstrate how
generally useless it is.  Rather than display a large number of 
nested value whose values, it might be nice to optionally filter this list 
somehow.

<ul>
<li><p>The Firebug display has grown significantly wider, presumably to 
accommodate longer property names after expansion.  This is not a good thing.
</ul>

<div class="figure">Firebug       <p><img src="fb-04.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Web Inspector <p><img src="wi-04.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Dragonfly     <p><img src="df-04.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Eclipse       <p><img src="ej-04.png"></div>
    
<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>REPL</h2>

<p>Each of the JavaScript debuggers supports a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop">REPL</a>
in some form.  For this set of images, I sequentially evaluated
the variable names <code>aMap</code>, <code>anArray</code>, and
<code>anElement</code>.

<p>The results are pretty much what we would expect given what we've 
seen so far, with some surprises.

<ul>
    
<li><p>For Firebug and Web Inspector, when <code>anElement</code> is evaluated by itself, it renders
an HTML source rendition of the element.  For Web Inspector, the HTML
source rendition is also displayed for the element within the <code>anArray</code>
variable.

<li><p>Web Inspector also provides disclosure triangles for nested objects
within the console display.  The second Web Inspector image shows
the result of clicking on a disclosure triangle; the results are 
displayed inline within the console.  Nifty!
    
</ul>

<div class="figure">Firebug                            <p><img src="fb-05.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Web Inspector                      <p><img src="wi-05.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Web Inspector with expanded Object <p><img src="wi-06.png"></div>
<div class="figure">Dragonfly                          <p><img src="df-05.png"></div>
    
<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>Summary / Thoughts</h2>

<p>As noted, Firebug has a bug or two to work out, but is considered the gold
standard of JavaScript debuggers.  Primarily because it's the only debugger 
that developers even realize exist today.  But it also currently wins 
on features alone, including:

<ul>
<li>displaying <code>toString()</code> representations where appropriate
<li>use of color to distinguish data types
</ul>

<p>Dragonfly is the newest of the debuggers, and has some room for growth.
Once some of the styling issues are resolved, it really just needs to add
<code>toString()</code> representations where appropriate.

<p>Web Inspector could make use of styling data types ala Firebug and Dragonfly,
adding <code>toString()</code> representations where appropriate, and it will
then be pretty much up-to-snuff.

<p>General issues concerning all the debuggers is dealing with objects
which you'd like to see different representations.  Web Inspector and
Firebug both display nice renderings of HTML elements, but only in the 
console.  And frankly, this is too browser specific.  Need to think wider,
as more folks start to look at using JavaScript on the server.  How can
we accommodate application- or user- specific renderings for objects to
make debugging that much nicer of an environment.

<p>One feature I didn't show was Eclipse's 
<a href="http://blog.jcake.com/2008/03/05/eclipse-debugger-part-i-detailed-formatters/">Detail Formatters</a>.
A Detail Formatter provides a runtime override of the <code>toString()</code> 
method for a particular class.  These are stored persistently in your 
workspace, so you don't need to edit them every time.

<p>This feature is nice, as it allows you to extend runtime behavior just 
while debugging - no code was harmed or edited while debugging.  Such a 
feature would be nice to provide for JavaScript as well.
