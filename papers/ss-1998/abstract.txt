At the 1997 Fall Comdex show, IBM, Delco Electronics, Netscape
Communications and Sun Microsystems presented "the network vehicle", a
concept car with wireless Internet connections, voice control, head up
display, and other hardware and software innovations for automobiles.
Smalltalk was used to integrate many systems, implement much of the

existing networks on the car.  The experience report will talk about how
and why Smalltalk was used on the car.
