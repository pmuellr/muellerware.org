<h2>T1 - Smalltalk in the Network Vehicle</h2>
<br>Patrick Mueller

<p>&quot;The network vehicle&quot; is a concept car with wireless Internet connections, 
voice control, heads up display, and other hardware and software innovations 
for automobiles. Smalltalk is used to integrate many systems, implement much 
of the logic on the car including voice recognition, and interface with existing 
networks on the car. The session will talk about how and why Smalltalk was 
used to develop this vehicle.
