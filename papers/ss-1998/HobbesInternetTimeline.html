<center><h3><a NAME="FAQ">Hobbes' Internet Timeline FAQ</a></h3></center>
<dl>
<dt>1. Why did you compile Hobbes' Internet Timeline?
<dd>For use in the Internet courses I taught: Introduction to the Internet,
   Internet Tools Administration, and Net Surfing 101.
<p>
<dt>2. How do I get Hobbes' Internet Timeline?
<dd>The Timeline is archived at: <a HREF="http://info.isoc.org/guest/zakon/Internet/History/HIT.html">http://info.isoc.org/guest/zakon/Internet/History/HIT.html</a>.
   If you prefer a copy via e-mail, send a blank message to timeline@hobbes.mitre.org. 
   For comments/corrections please use hobbes@hobbes.mitre.org.  
<p>
<dt>3. What do you do at MITRE?
<dd>I design the soccer shoe of the future (wrong MITRE :-)  Actually, I 
   wear the following hats: Net Evangelist, HCI Engineer, Systems Integrator,
   Information Engineer, NIDR Administrator, Lead Scientist, Instructor, 
   Cognitive Scientist, manager, He with the Most Toys
<p>
<dt>4. Why don't you list the # of Internet users?
<dd>This is too controversial, and relatively inaccurate, an issue which the 
   author does not want to get flamed or spammed for.  His guess would be 
   between 1 (himself) and 5 billion (but then again, one never knows if 
   you're a dog on the Net). 
<p>
<dt>5. Is your license plate really NET SURF?
<dd>Yes, and there is a frame around it with INTERNET at the top, and my
   e-mail address at the bottom. (My wife is too embarrassed to drive it:)
   Oh, and the bumper sticker says &quot;I'd Rather Be Net Surfing&quot;.<br>
   Actually as of this printing, Hobbes is without a car, (don't worry
   I still have the plates), so if you'd like to seel yours cheap drop 
   an email.
<p>
<dt>6. Can I re-print the Timeline or use parts of it for ... ?
<dd>Drop me an e-mail.  The answer is most likely (though don't assume) 'yes' 
   for non-profit use, and 'maybe' for for-profit; but to be sure you are not 
   going to break any copyright laws, drop me an e-mail and wait for a reply.
<p>
<dt>[ I realize the question below is outdated, but I leave it as proof of
  my prediction powers :-]
<dt>7. Who do you think is going to win the '94 World Cup?
<dd>Brasil, of course!  (I was born in Rio de Janeiro ...)
<p>
<dt>8. Peddie (Ala Viva!), CWRU (North Side), Amici Usque Ad Aras (OH Epsilon)
<dd>E-mail me if you know
