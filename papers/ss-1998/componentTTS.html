<ul>
<li>IBM ViaVoice includes Text-To-Speech (TTS) component called VirtualVoices.
<li>VirtualVoices packaged as an ActiveX control.
<li>Wrapped into Smalltalk with OleApplicationFramework.
<li>Application variable created as single access point.
<li>Existing Smalltalk classes such as Time, Date, Integer, Fraction extended with method
<bold>speakString</bold>.  speakString answers a string which can be 'spoken' by VirtualVoices.
Examples:
<ul>
<li>Date today speakString -- 'Tuesday, April 14th 1998'
<li>Time now speakString -- '11:05 p m'
<li>(1/7) speakString -- '1 seventh'
</ul>
<li>TTS usage had to be coordinated with Voice Recognition and RealAudio since only one can use
the sound card at a time.
<li>Audio volume level temporarily reset to a 'standard' volume.
</ul>
