<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Over the last few years, the World Wide Web has grown enormously.
Starting from a simple text and image hypertext-based system, the Web
has started to take on the appearance of becoming a network-based
application development platform.

<p>Over the same period, a number of products offering distributed
object technology have become available on the commercial marketplace.
These include everything from proprietary systems to open systems often
implemented as CORBA-based Object Request Brokers.  None of these
products has yet to gain wide acceptance in the marketplace, at least
nearly as wide acceptance as World Wide Web browsers and servers enjoy.

<p>This presentation will explore the possibilities of why and how to
leverage the popularity of the Web, in particular HTTP, within
distributed object systems by using HTTP as a transport for
remote object method invocation.

<h2>Why leverage HTTP within Distributed Object Systems?</h2>

<p>The HTTP protocol is a simple client-server protocol for sending
messages to objects and having the objects send the result of the
message back to the sender.  In the Web as we know it today, this
usually means asking an object to send back an HTML or GIF
representation of itself.  Most of the time this is easy for the server
to answer, since the object is itself an HTML or GIF file, so the result
is nothing more than the contents of the file.  However, HTTP allows
much richer interaction:

<dl>
<dt>named objects
<dd>a hierarchical naming structure

<dt>methods
<dd>currently Web browsers issue nothing more than GET and POST, but the
original HTTP specs envisioned the verbs PUT, LINK, UNLINK, DELETE, etc.

<dt>typed parameters
<dd>Via the Content-type headers and request content

<dt>typed and negotiated results
<dd>Via the Content-type and Accept headers

</dl>

<p>Given this core set of functionality, it is possible to implement
distributed object systems on top of existing HTTP servers using the
Common Gateway Interface or other programming interfaces provided by
servers to extend their functionality.  This can be done by mapping
remote method invocation into HTTP requests and responses.

<p>Even basic HTTP capability, other tools and services have
been designed specifically for use with HTTP or because of HTTP:

<ul>
<li>Security (SSL and S-HTTP)
<li>network gateways (HTTP proxies and tunnels)
<li>application gateways (CGI-BIN, NSAPI, ISAPI)
<li>scaleable routers (ip sprayers, domain name rotation)
<li>logging tools
<li>connection-less/connection-based hybrids
</ul>

<p>Once the basic method invocation is defined, it
can usually immediately take advantage of all these tools and services.

<p>For the client programs however, we will need the ability to issue
HTTP requests.  Programming libraries to do this are becoming more and
more widespread.  Java ships one in it's java.net classes, Microsoft has
a WinInet DLL, etc.  Note that the use HTML browsers such as Netscape
Navigator are not considered in such a scenario, since they do not
generally provide rich, general purpose, object oriented programming
interfaces.

<h2>How to leverage HTTP within Distributed Object Systems</h2>

<p>A high level mapping of remote method invocation onto HTTP consists of:

<p>
<table border>
<tr><th>Remote Method invocation <th>HTTP
<tr><td>objects    <td>URLs
<tr><td>methods    <td>HTTP methods
<tr><td>parameters <td>request content
<tr><td>results    <td>response content
</table>

<p>The presentation will focus on answering a number of specific
questions:

<ul>
<li>How are objects named and located across the Web?
<li>What wire format is used for parameters and results?
<li>How can application gateways such as CGI-BIN programs be used
to implement remove method invocation servers?
<li>Can remote method invocation can be done in a language independent fashion?
<li>Can remote method invocation can be done in a language dependent fashion,
to take advantage of specific language features when it's known that the
client and server use the samem language?
<li>How can object oriented interfaces easily and programmatically be
mapped into HTTP-formatted requests?
</ul>
