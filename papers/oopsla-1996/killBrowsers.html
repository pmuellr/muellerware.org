<p>There doesn't seem to need to be a justification for marrying together
the Web and Object Oriented Technology.  Witness OOPSLA 95's Workshop
on Objects, Scripting, and the Web, the follow-on Birds-of-a-Feather,
the formation of a group in OMG focusing on the Web, all the long-time
OO vendors such as ParcPlace-Digitalk entering the Web market.  As
the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup commercial goes: <em>'Two great tastes that
taste great together'</em>.  However, there seems to be no clear concensus
on <b>how</b> to put the two together.

<p>Current approaches usually revolve around using object oriented
languages or systems as Common Gateway Programs.  But this usually
means that the the objects doing the work are doing nothing more
than parsing HTML form input, and spitting back HTML.  Objects are
only involved in the computation.

<p>Digging a bit deeper, the next attempt at getting OO and the Web
to work together would be to server up Objects over the Web instead
of just HTML and images.  Luckily, we can reuse much of what has
been invented over the last few years for HTTP including
scalability, security, and programmability when serving objects over
the web.  Unfortunately, we have to throw away our existing Web
browsers.  Web browsers are fantastic tools for viewing hypertext
documents, but are NOT the promised skinny-client-for-all-servers
that they have been touted as over the last few years.

<h2>Why Can't I use Web Browsers as a Universal Network Client?</h2>

<p>Would you consider using your favorite word processor as a GUI
programming environment for writing application programs?  Probably not.
Yet many people consider existing Web browsers, which have in many ways
less function than word processors, to be perfectly acceptable client
desktop to serve up networked applications.  The Web and Web browsers
we all use today are perfectly acceptable for use certain types of
applications - stock quotes, address lookups, online catalog lookup.
There are other types of applications which would be nearly impossible
to implement easily on the Web today.

<p>Factors that make some applications impossible or impractical to build
today:

<dl>
<dt>time travel
<dd>The ubiqituous backward and forward buttons in browsers are usually
completely inappropriate for use in stateful applications.

<dt>lack of state
<dd>Web browsers maintain very little state about the current page
being viewed; usually just enough to be able to redisplay the page.
Web servers by definition are stateless - to add state usually requires
writing complicated server programs.

<dt>lack of rich user entry controls
<dd>HTML has only crude user input controls, and is missing things users
are starting to expect in applications like hierarchical lists,
multi-window applications, spread-sheet like tables, etc.

</dl>

<p>Many of these problems appear to be nearly solvable with the addition
of a little JavaScript, cookies, Java applets, etc.  While each of these
adds some functionality to Web browsers, they are also not much more
than bolting a new set of things to be programmed onto a tool which
isn't really capable of handling the job (HTML).  For instance, if you want
to create a new widget for use in HTML pages in Java, you not only have
to write the widget itself, but for every page that wants to use it you
will have to add some JavaScript so that it can interact with the other
HTML elements around it.  Otherwise it'll have to act as a little
mini-application within a Web page, unable to affect or be affected
by the things around it.

<p>What's wrong with this picture.  HTML.  So let's consider getting
rid of HTML, and along with it the Web browsers.  If we're not going
to use HTML, we won't need an HTML browser!
