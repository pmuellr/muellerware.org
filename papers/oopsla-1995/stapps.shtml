<!-- title: Smalltalk Applications over the Web -->

<font size=30>
<ul>
<li>Most Smalltalk implementations provide a way to store classes
in a portable, distributable format (worse case is to store the
source code).<p>
<li>VisualAge provides a facility to dynamically load compiled classes to a
running image.<p>
<li>Provides the same basic capability as Java - ship the entire
application (applet) over the network.
</ul>
