<h1>A Taste of JSON Schema</h1>

<h2>Introduction to JSON</h2>

<p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a term coined by 
<a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a>
to describe literal JavaScript objects.  The seminal site
describing JSON is 
<a href="http://www.json.org">http://www.json.org</a>.  It is not
a new language, but a subset of JavaScript.</p>

<p>JSON has gained popularity as the output of web services
returning structured data, as these services are typically used
by AJAXy web pages.  The JavaScript on those pages can (but probably
shouldn't) <code>eval()</code> the resulting JSON output, directly
yielding a rich JavaScript object.  
JSON is more officially described by the IETF Informational 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt?number=4627">Request For Comments 4627</a>.</p>

<p>Although JSON is interesting for JavaScript programs because it can be directly
evaluated by a JavaScript interpreter, for the purposes of this paper, the interest
is in the fact that JSON can describe fairly rich data structures that can be
translated easily into most programming languages.</p>

<p>JSON supports data of the following types:</p>

<ul>
<li>numbers (integers and real)</li>
<li>booleans</li>
<li>strings</li>
<li>null</li>
<li>arrays</li>
<li>maps</li>
</ul>

<p>Arrays and maps are the compositing data structures.  Arrays are what
you would expect, a list of indexable values, which may be of any type.
Maps are commonly referred to as hash tables, hashes, dictionaries, 
and associative arrays.  They are a collection of key/value pairs, where
the key is a string, and the value may be of any type.<p>
    
<p>Note that in JavaScript, maps are also used to represent 'objects', 
where the keys are considered 'properties' of the object.</p>

<p>Let's provide a simple example: a shopping list for a store.  I won't
bother breaking the syntax down, it should be fairly obvious.</p>

<pre>
{
    "store" : "BuyMore",
    "items" : [
        { 
            "quantity" : 1, 
            "item" : "avocado"
        },
        { 
            "quantity" : 4, 
            "item" : "potatoes"
        },
    ]
}
</pre>

<p>This object describes a shopping list for the store "BuyMore", with the 
list items of 1 avocado and 4 potatoes.</p>

<!-- =================================================================== -->
<h2>Schema?  We don't need no stinkin' schema!</h2>

<p>It is this author's premise that, yes, we do need schema.  We just
don't want it to stink, like schema is wont to do.  Just as XML 
schema can be used by (some) humans and programs to understand the
structure of XML data, so JSON schema can be used by humans and
programs to understand the structure of JSON data.
</p>
    
<p>Let's consider a possible schema for the previous shopping list,
described in JSON itself.  Just as XML schema is described in
XML (in some cases anyway), so JSON can be used to describe
it's own schema</p>

<pre>
[
    {
        "name" : "ShoppingList",
        "type" : "Object",
        "elements" : [
            {
                "name" : "store",
                "type" : "String"
            },
            {
                "name" : "items",
                "type" : "Array",
                "elementType" : "ShoppingListItem"
            }
        ]
    },

    {
        "name" : "ShoppingListItem",
        "type" : "Object",
        "elements" : [
            {
                "name" : "quantity",
                "type" : "Integer"
            },
            {
                "name" : "item",
                "type" : "String"
            },
        ]
    }
]
</pre>

<p>This schema describes two types, <code>ShoppingList</code> and
<code>ShoppingListItem</code>, each represented as a JSON map,
and the two composited into a JSON array.</p>  

<p>The JSON types
<code>Object</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Array</code> and
<code>Integer</code> are used internally to describe the
value types.  These names map into the JavaScript type names used
by the respective types.</p>  

<p>Each data element is described with at least a <code>name</code>
and <code>type</code> element.  Objects (maps) also contain an
<code>elements</code> element which describes the constituent
elements.  Arrays contain an <code>elementType</code> element
describing the type of the items in the array.</p>

<!-- =================================================================== -->
<h2>Where to go from here?</h2>

<p>We are not trying to fully describe any possible JSON structure that can
be built.  Rather, we are trying to describe a useful subset of JSON structures
that are likely to be used by program-to-program communication, and that can
easily be mapped into existing programming language structures.  For instance,
handling of heterogeneous arrays is not specified.</p>

<p>Even given that constraint, there are plenty of issues to be solved:</li>
	
<ul>
	
<li>Namespacing; ideally we'd like to be able to reference JSON
schema types arbitrarily, without having to worry about type names
overwriting each other.</li>

<li>Additional native types like Dates.</li>

<li>Adding human readable descriptions of the schema elements.</li>

<li>Adding additional contraints on items; maximum/minimum lengths
of strings, lengths of arrays, other validations of elements.</li>

</ul>
