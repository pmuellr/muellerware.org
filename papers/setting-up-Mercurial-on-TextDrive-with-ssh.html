<p>I've been thinking about setting up a simpler, change-set based source code
repository for my little personal projects for a while now.  
For the past six months or so I've been using SVN on my TextDrive account
but ... looking for something different.
</p>

<p>I ran across
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a>
(<tt>hg</tt>) at 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/mr/entry/openjdk_scm">least</a> 
<a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/preed/2007/04/version_control_system_shootou_1.html">twice</a>
now recently, so that speaks to me "check it out".  Getting it set up on my local box 
was straightforward, and of course the next step is getting it set up on your server.
I host at TextDrive.  And Bill de h&Oacute;ra recently 
<a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/04/mercurial_part_ii.html">posted some instructions</a>
on how to do just that.  Kind of.
</p>

<p>The problem with Bill's instructions are that you're setting it up to run using 
Basic Auth but using http instead of https.  Bill points out himself, that
<b>"This isn't secure"</b>.  Using https with TextDrive is possible, but at
times confusing.  Luckily, there is a fairly straight-forward way to get to
a secure solution.
</p>

<p>The basic idea is to use the <tt>ssh</tt> instead of <tt>http</tt> for when accessing your hg
repositories programmatically.  Instructions on using <tt>ssh</tt> with <tt>hg</tt> are available in the
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hg.1.html">hg(1) man page</a>.
</p>

<p>In a nutshell, follow Bill's instructions, with a few slight changes, and 
it just works, assuming you have 
<a href="http://kimmo.suominen.com/docs/ssh/">ssh set up in the first place</a>.</p>

<p>If this doesn't work, ping me; I perhaps forgot a step.</p>

<p>I also created a <tt>~.hgrc</tt> file on my client box, with the following
contents.  The ssh setting causes ssh to use compression when transfering the data/files.</p>

<pre>
    [ui]
    username = your name &lt;yourname@yourmail&gt;
    ssh = ssh -C
</pre>

<p>The only thing I don't like about the resulting set up is having to
update the <tt>hgweb.config</tt> file on the server whenever you create
a new repository.  Though I suppose it's nice that you can selectively
make repositories easily publicly accessible or not this way.  I 
don't think I'd rely on this trick to hide something.</p>

<p>Here are Bill's instructions, with changes made.  
Stuff I've deleted is in <span style="background-color:FFAFAF"><strike>red and striked out</strike></span>,
stuff I've added is in <span style="background-color:AFFFAF">green</span>,
stuff I've changed is in <span style="background-color:AFAFFF">blue</font>.

<div style="background-color:#CFCFCF; border-width:1; padding:5; border-style:solid;">
<p>Install mercurial in your home folder:</p>

<pre>
    #mkdir ~/local; mkdir ~/local/mercurial
    # cd ~local
    # wget http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/release/mercurial-0.9.3.tar.gz 
    # tar xvzf mercurial-0.9.3.tar.gz 
    # cd  ~/local/mercurial-0.9.3
    # python setup.py install --home=~/local/mercurial
    # nano ~/.profile
    PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/local/mercurial/lib/python; <span style="background-color:AFFFAF">export PYTHONPATH</span>
    PATH=${HOME}/local/mercurial/bin:$PATH; <span style="background-color:AFFFAF">export PATH</span>
    #export PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/local/mercurial/lib/python
    #export PATH=${HOME}/local/mercurial/bin:$PATH
</pre>

<p><span style="background-color:AFFFAF">
To get <tt>hg</tt> running with <tt>ssh</tt>, you'll also need to make sure
your shell initialization for <tt>ssh</tt> sessions runs these commands as well.  I just copied
the <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt> and <tt>PATH</tt> settings to my <tt>.bashrc</tt> file
as well.  Not very DRY; ah well.  I've not spent a whole lot of time setting up
my shell account <i>up there</i>.</span>
</p>

<p>Create a base configuration file:</p>

<pre>
    # touch ~/.hgrc
    # nano ~/.hgrc
    [ui]
    username = your name <span style="background-color:AFFFAF">&lt;yourname@yourmail&gt;</span>
    </pre>

<p>Check your setup:</p>

<pre>
    # hg debuginstall
    Checking encoding (US-ASCII)...
    Checking extensions...
    Checking templates...
    Checking patch...
    Checking merge helper...
    Checking commit editor...
    Checking username...
    No problems detected
</pre>

<p>Make a public repository area, and serve it:</p>

<pre>
# mkdir ~/web/public/hg
# mkdir ~/web/public/hg/repos
<span style="background-color:AFFFAF"># ln -s ~/web/public/hg/ ~/hg</span>
</pre>

<p><span style="background-color:AFFFAF">The symlink was added because
using ssh means having to specify the complete path to your repository
relative to your home directory.  Which would mean that <tt>web/public</tt>
would show up in your <tt>ssh</tt> urls.  Ick.  Even still, you'll
see that the <tt>repos</tt> path segment shows up in the <tt>ssh</tt>
urls, but not in the http ones.  Deal.</span>
</p>

<p>~/web/public/hg/repos is where you will create your public mercurial repositories. 
<span style="background-color:FFAFAF"><strike>Note that symlinking into here doesn't work, they have to be housed.</strike></span> 
To serve it out</p>

<pre>
    # cp  ~/local/mercurial-0.9.3/hgwebdir.cgi  ~/web/public/hg
    # chmod 755 ~/web/public/hg/hgwebdir.cgi
    # nano ~/web/public/hg/hgwebdir.cgi
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, "/users/home/$youraccountname/local/mercurial/lib/python")
</pre>

<p>Now tell the cgi where the repos are (for example suppose we had created a repo called 'weblog'):</p>

<pre>
    # nano ~/web/public/hg/hgweb.config 
    [paths]
    weblog = repos/weblog
</pre>

<p><span style="background-color:FFAFAF"><strike>Create a user account for pushing changes:</strike></span></p>

<pre>
<span style="background-color:FFAFAF"><strike>    # mkdir etc
    # htpasswd -c ~/etc/hgpasswd $mercurialname</strike></span>
</pre>

<p>Configure apache access to the repositories:</p>

<pre>
    # nano ~/web/public/hg/.htaccess 

    Options +ExecCGI
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /hg
    RewriteRule ^$ hgwebdir.cgi  [L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule (.*) hgwebdir.cgi/$1  [QSA,L]
<span style="background-color:FFAFAF"><strike>    AuthUserFile /users/home/$youraccountname/etc/hgpasswd
    AuthGroupFile /dev/null
    AuthName "My Repository"
    AuthType Basic
    &lt;Limit POST PUT&gt;
    Require valid-user
    &lt;/Limit&gt;</strike></span>
</pre>

<p>the above will allow anyone to browse</p>

<pre>
    http://$yourdomain/hg
</pre>

and see all the repositories under:

<pre>
    ~/web/public/hg/repos
</pre>

<p>The Auth* directives mean commits are restricted to authenticated users, but anyone can browse (if you want to restrict browsing add GET to the methods in &lt;Limit&gt;. The rewrite rules are <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/PublishingRepositories">explained in the mercurial wiki</a>. </p>

<p><span style="background-color:FFAFAF"><strike>For each repository under repos you'll need to add the following to its .hg/hgrc file:</strike></span></p>

<pre>
<span style="background-color:FFAFAF"><strike>    [web]
    push_ssl = false
    allow_push = $mercurialname</strike></span>
</pre> 

<p><span style="background-color:FFAFAF"><strike>where "$mercurialname " matches what you added to hgpasswd earlier. 
<b>This isn't secure</b> - mercurial by default does not allow push over http, 
with good reason, you have to disable via push_ssl. If you can get a https setup 
running in TextDrive, you should do so (and tell me what you did ;).</strike></span>

<p>To pull a repository down via HTTP use "hg clone":</p>

<pre>
    # hg clone <span style="background-color:AFAFFF">ssh</span>://$yourdomain/hg/<span style="background-color:AFFFAF">repos/</span>weblog weblog

</pre>

<p>To commit <span style="background-color:FFAFAF"><strike>(you'll be challenged for auth details)</strike></span>:</p>

<pre>
    # cd weblog
    do work
    # hg ci -m "my changes"
    # hg push <span style="background-color:AFAFFF">ssh</span>://$yourdomain/hg/<span style="background-color:AFFFAF">repos/</span>weblog
    pushing to <span style="background-color:AFAFFF">ssh</span>://$yourdomain/hg/<span style="background-color:AFFFAF">repos/</span>weblog
    searching for changes
<span style="background-color:FFAFAF"><strike>    http authorization required
    realm: My Repository
    user: $mercurialname
    password: </strike></span>
