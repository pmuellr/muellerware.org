<h1>OOPSLA 2003 Trip Report</h1>

<p><a href="http://oopsla.acm.org/oopsla2003/files/">OOPSLA 2003</a>
was Sunday, October 26 through Thursday, October 30, in Anaheim, CA.
Across the street from Disney World, which will be the site of
<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org">EclipseCon</a>
early next year.  A guess at attendance was about ~1200, based on the
number of seats available at the keynote sessions.  There was no exhibit
hall as in previous years (this is my first OOPSLA since, I think, 1999),
although they did have a room with a lot of books you could buy.

<p>Highlights for me were the eclipse Technology Exchange (Sunday) and Welcome Reception (Monday),
as these were poster-based, so you could actually talk one-on-one with the folks doing the work.

<p>The Los Angeles and San Diego areas had lots of fires before, during,
and after OOPSLA. I could see some fires burning when I flew in.  On Sunday,
it was quite smoky in the city, and smelled like a big camp fire.  The
rest of the week was not quite as bad.

<p>I have two pictures of the smoke or effects.  The first is
<a href="CaliforniaFires2003-Midday-Sun.jpg">10am outside the hotel on Sunday</a>.  The second is
a smoke plume I happened to catch at
<a href="CaliforniaFires2003-Zuma.jpg">Zuma beach about 2pm on Sunday</a> (an hour north of
Anaheim).

<p>Stop by if you want to take a look at the proceedings, which contain
all the technical papers presented at the conference.

<h1>Sunday</h1>

<h2>Special Event: eclipse Technology Exchange</h2>

<p>This event had a number of
'posters' on eclipse-related projects.  In fact, many (all?) of the projects were all awarded
<a href="http://www-3.ibm.com/software/info/university/products/eclipse/eig-2003.html">eclipse innovation grants</a>, and this was their opportunity to show off their
work.

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<h1>Monday</h1>

<h2>Workshop: Pervasive Computing: Going beyond the Internet for small screens</h2>

<p>This was my free ticket to OOPSLA.  You can see the position papers
<a href="http://jeckstein.com/oopsla/pervasive-computing/">here</a>.
The focus of the workshop is a little vaguer than I would like, I suspect
I won't go to the one next year (I think this is the 3rd annual workshop for
them).

<h2>Special Event: Welcome Reception</h2>

<p>This event had all the OOPSLA posters; lots of interesting ones; lots of
dull ones (on UML/Modelling/Design - blechh!).  There are no links to the poster contents that I
know of, but there is a list of them at:
<a href="http://oopsla.acm.org/oopsla2003/files/pos.html">http://oopsla.acm.org/oopsla2003/files/pos.html</a>,
and the poster contents are available in hardcopy in the OOPSLA 2003 Companion 'book' (stop by to borrow).

<h1>Tuesday</h1>

<h2>Invited Speaker: Free Culture: The limited but essential role of property in building an environment for creativity</h2>

<p>This was a talk by <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a>.  Really entertaining, and educational if
you aren't a regular Slashdot reader and don't know what the DMCA is <tt>:-)</tt>.

<h2>Technical Paper: Language independent aspect-oriented programming</h2>

<p>This is AspectJ, only for <strike>Microsoft's</strike> ECMA's Common
Language Runtime (ie, C# et al), and in a completely unwritable and unreadable
XML syntax.  Can't wait!  I left early.  The work is called Weave.net.

<h2>Demo: F-Script: Smalltalk scripting for the Mac OSX object system</h2>

<p>Pure eye candy: Smalltalk.  Mac OSX.  But only as a big honkin' script;
you can't actually define your own classes or anything (in Smalltalk anyway).
Makes use of anything in the Cocoa (NextStep) class libraries.  Has a
Cocoa Class Hierarchy Browser, as well as an 'object inspector' browser.
Kinda cool; I'll definitely download it to take a look.

<h2>Invited Speaker: Grid-supported communications applications</h2>

<p>Gerald Labedz  from Motorola who invented the secondary channels on the family
radio walkie talkies back in the 70's.  I didn't really understand the big
deal of the talk, which basically boiled down to: faster computers are faster
than slower computers; more than one computer can do more work than one
computer; and, you can take multiple pieces of software and program them so they
can do something useful.  I left early to go to the demo below, and then, having
left the demo early, came back here to see the 'amazing demo', but sadly I missed
it.  Something about doing 3-D on a grid.  Damn, I bet it was great, to!
I also thought the speaker was rather annoying.

<h2>Demo: ATCT: a Java framework that offers new approach to developing asynchronous processes</h2>

<p>This was the first of the first of two demos that purported to, in
the presented papers, to do something really interesting, and basically,
seemingly impossible, with standard Java VMs.  The other being the JPie demo (see
below).

<p>So, this guy claimed to have continuations in Java.  Clearly impossible,
at least with any standard VM.  A continuation is like a setjmp()/longjmp()
in C, which let's a function (method in Java), return to it's caller, but
remember it's state so it can be restarted later.
Here's a link to <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/alexkrut/">examples using the ATCT framework</a>.

<p>Continuations are obviously pretty cool, and if you think about it for
a minute, clearly impossible to implement in a standard VM with just C
and Java; they're aren't enough APIs to implement them.  BTW, Envy Smalltalk
had continuations, but they came kind of late, and were implemented as
part of an exception handling scheme that would allow you to try to
'fix' whatever caused the exception, and try the thing that caused the
exception again.  Very cool.  Lisp, Python, et al, have continuations.

<p>Anyhoo, this guy basically started talking about the 'secondary'
interpreter, and so you could see where this was going.  He actually has
his own Java bytecode interpreter, that he runs when he has to do bits
with the continuation stuff.  And no doubt this is a big wad of horrifying
C code, since you'd need to do it in C for speed.  Like it matters, since
he's selling this as a product.  Move along, nothing interesting to see here.

<h2>Practictioner Report: Experience in developing the UrbanSim System</h2>

<p>Bjorn Freeman-Benson (ex-OTI guy) did this talk.  It was supposed
to be on the tools he used to build his project, however he gave the
crowd a choice of hearing about the tools or the project itself, and
almost all 15 of us voted to hear about the project itself.

<p>Best described as a real-life version of SimCity, only generating
lots of numbers instead of cartoonish cities, and aimed at
determining traffic patterns in the future for urban environments.
The talk was entertaining, and included lots of interesting anecdotes
on his experiences running UrbanSim for a number of municipalities.

<h2>Demo: Using events to debug Java programs backwards in time</h2>

<p>I got to this demo real late, and the guy running it seemed a bit
odd.  He was running a demo showing a debugger stepping backwards in
time.  Chris Laffra asked how much space was required to store the debug data,
and he didn't answer, so Chris asked again, and he didn't answer, so I left.

<p>I knew there was going to be something weird about this demo, since
part of the description included the text: "To our best knowledge, this
is the first event model for Java".  Oh yeah, noone had <b>ever</b>
used events before this ...

<h2>Special Event: Java Community Process reception</h2>

<p>I was honestly hoping to meet some of the clowns responsible
for the JCP and various JSRs, but seeing as they had ~500 people
in a really small room, with no clear indication of who these
people might be, I left early.

<h2>Special Event: eclipse Plug-in Reception</h2>

<p>Erich Gamma and John Wiegand ran this session, which I will admit
I went mainly so I could get a fast internet connection to check my
mail, only to find out that they weren't providing interet access.
Bastards!  But, got dinner, chatted with folks, etc.  They had quite a few
people there, and were running some kind of you-program-the-cars
racing game.

<h1>Wednesday</h1>

<h2>Keynote: Seven Paradoxes of Object-Oriented Programming Languages</h2>

Dave Ungar gave this talk.  He only talked about three of the paradoxes,
and the talk could have easily been retitled: Why Self does not suffer the
seven paradoxes of most other Object-Oriented Programming Languages.
General bashing of C++ and Java.  So, that was fun.  And actually
the talk was quite interesting.
<p>Link to overview on the web at:
<a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2003/files/long-spe.html#key-4">http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2003/files/long-spe.html#key-4</a>

<h2>Technical Paper: Model Driven Development: The case for domain oriented programming</h2>

<p>Dave Thomas (the OTI one) gave this paper, and talked about the need to have
domain experts and computer scientists work on problems together, using
non-standard 'programming' tools.  For some specific types of applications.
As usual, from Dave, interesting, and
made you think a little.

<h2>Demo: Jazz: A collaborative application development environment</h2>

<p>Some guys from IBM Cambridge who have some eclipse plugins that talk to
their "Collaboration Server" so you can do all kinds of cool collaborative
things within eclipse (think, Sametime within Eclipse, only you can also
use contexts from the environment).  Lots of eye candy, but I'm not sure
if it would really be useful.  The code is not yet available to the public,
but I asked him after the demo if IBMers could get access to it, and
he said yes.  If anyone's interested.  Persona record of the guy is
<a href="http://w3.ibm.com/persona/users/8/0/7/8073712A4.html">here</a>.

<h2>Demo: JPie: An environment for live software construction in Java</h2>

<p>This was the second "runs on a standard vm" and yet does something impossible
demo.  The other was the ATCT stuff.  This one purported to suppport dynamic classes
such that you could add/change methods, fields, etc in the class, while it was
running.  Again, seems impossible.  Although, you can do some amount of class changes
using 'hot code swap' when debugging.

<p>But no, this was another 'we have our own bytecode interpreter' story.  Bonus, you
couldn't really add new methods, only override methods of your superclass.  Bonus,
provided a programming interface that looked like Lego Mindstorms on steroids.  This
was supposed to be for beginning programmers, but it looked way too confusing, beyond
the obvious 'useless' aspect.

<h2>Demo: AspectJ development tools</h2>

<p>This was really an intro to AspectJ, and we'll use the eclipse plugins to show you
how to do it.  I guess they had to do this, for folks not familiar with AspectJ, but
it taking too long, so I didn't stay long.

<h2>Panel: Innovate</h2>

<p>This was supposed to be a panel discussion of how to get you or folks you
work with to innovate more.  But, to me, it was more like: you need to plan
to innovate, you need to get management approval to innovate, etc.  In a word,
they made it sound really distasteful to innovate.  What a bummer.

<h2>Demo: Building compilers for micro-programmable graphics processors</h2>

<p>The guy giving this demo, Yahya Mirza, talked my ear off on
Sunday night about the work he's hoping to do on PlayStation 3 graphics, as
if I could help him get contacts for this in IBM (I guess they are using
PowerPC).  I promised him I'd go to the demo.  It was basically a quick overview
of how current GPUs used in graphics cards are used with OpenGL and DirectX9.
Pretty interesting.

<h2>Panel: Model Driven Architecture: How far have we come, how far can we go?</h2>

<p>This was the last event I went to, and a great way to end the conference.
The panel was a bunch of UML / Modelling wienies, including some big names
like Ivar Jakobson and Stephen Mellor.  And Dave Thomas (the OTI one). So, everyone did their
opening statement, talking about how great MDM and UML are, and then it's Dave
turn, and he spares not a second cutting them all down.  And the vocal
crowd (~200 people) were clearly on his side.  Lots of fun.  And then
for the final statements, Dave went out with a bang, starting off with
something to the effect "When you get home, have your company write a letter
to Richard Soley (head of the OMG) telling them you are cancelling your
membership because OMG (organization that 'owns' UML) is an organization
that just does design-by-committee paper
specs that have no basis in reality .... blah blah blah".  Again, lots of
fun.
