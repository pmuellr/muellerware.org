<br>W4 - Interfacing Smalltalk Systems to the Web 
<br>Patrick Mueller

</font>
<font size="4">
<p>There are currently a number of products available for Smalltalk that allow you to hook
Smalltalk up to Web servers, including ParcPlace-Digitalk's VisualWave and IBM's Web
Connection feature for VisualAge. Unfortunately, many of the programming models and
facilities we have come to rely on over the years do not work over the Web, including
access to a rich and elaborate Graphical User Interface, the ability to assume a single user
is accessing your program at a time, etc. This class will discuss some of the traps
associated with programming for the Web, as well as some of the tricks which can allow
you to take full advantage of the power of the World Wide Web. 

<p>Patrick Mueller is a member of the VisualAge for Smalltalk development crew at IBM in
Research Triangle Park, NC. He is the technical lead for the Web Connection feature for
VisualAge for Smalltalk. He has been dabbling in programming for the internet for over 30
years (internet years, that is) and dabbling in programming for the Web since 1994.
