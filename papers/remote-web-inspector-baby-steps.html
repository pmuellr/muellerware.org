<p><i>(Note that some areas of the image above have been

<p>This is a baling-wire-and-duct-tape effort to get a version of the
Web Inspector debugger that ships with WebKit to run targeting a remote
browser.  In this case, an iPhone.  Well, the picture shows the iPhone
simulator, but this actually runs on my iPod Touch also.

<p>You're looking at three programs running, each potentially on a separate machine:
<ul>
    
<li><p>the debug client - on the upper left is
Safari running on Windows (in VNC), loaded with the Web Inspector code
running as a "web app"

<li><p>the debug target - on the right is the iPhone Simulator
running as a Mac app, running a very simple page which responds to
the "click me" link by writing some text to the console.  

<li><p>the debug agent - on the bottom
is a web server running in Python in a green Terminal window 
that is talking to both of the other
programs, acting as a switchboard.
</ul>

<p>Technically, this effort is less functional that Joe Hewitt's
<a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/firebug_for_iph.php">"Firebug for iPhone"</a>
code.  Namely, the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop">REPL</a> 
for the console is non-operational; the only thing
that works is <tt>console.log()</tt> invocations being forwarded to
Web Inspector's console.  (Note however, I wasn't able to get Joe's
code linked to in the blog post to run correctly.)
The big upside to this hack over "Firebug for iPhone"
is that this is running with the current
Web Inspector code, unchanged, but with some of "overridden"
function added.

<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>Technical Details</h2>

<p>Basically what's happening is that the two web apps - 
the debug target and the debug client - are communicating via XHR to the
debug agent, which is a Python program; it's acting as an
HTTP server (obviously).  When one of the web apps wants to
send a message to the other web app, it sends it via XHR to the agent,
which forwards it to the other web app.

<p>Both web apps also poll the agent to wait for a command
from the other web app.  Because I was too lazy to figure out
how to run the Python server threaded, this isn't using a 
"long poll", but a "short/frequent" poll.  Survivable, for the
moment, but this has to change.  You can see the frequent polling
in the debug agent Terminal window - each line is the terminal
output is an HTTP request.

<p>Also note that the debug agent also serves up the Web Inspector
code (HTML/CSS/JS) to the debug client, and so the XHRs between
the two are same-origin.  However, it's a pain to have the debug
target have to use same-origin for the code being debugged (your app), as
well as for talking to the debug agent.  For this linkage, I took
advantage of Mobile Safari's 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-cors-20090317/">CORS</a>
support so the debug agent doesn't have to be same origin
as the code being debugged.

<p>This is literally baby steps; there's lots of work to do here.

<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>Digging a little deeper</h2>

<h3>Debug target</h3>

<p>Here's the code which makes up the debug target, which is the
code being debugged.  Note that the idea here is that this is 
actually the application being debugged, so I've highlighted the
extra code needed to enable the debugging.

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
<b>RemWiServer = &quot;http://debug-agent-host/&quot;</b> <span class="num-marker">1</span>
&lt;/script&gt;

<b>&lt;script src=&quot;json2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</b>  <span class="num-marker">2</span>

<b>&lt;script src=&quot;http://debug-agent-host/remwi-common.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</b>  <span class="num-marker">3</span>
<b>&lt;script src=&quot;http://debug-agent-host/remwi-target.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</b>  

&lt;script&gt;
function dumpObject(name, object) {

    var output = name + &quot;:\n&quot;
    for (var key in object) {
        output += &quot;   &quot; + key + &quot;: &quot; + object[key] + &quot;\n&quot;
    }
    return output + &quot;\n&quot;
}

function whenClicked() {
    <b>console.log(&quot;the link was clicked at &quot; + new Date())</b>  <span class="num-marker">4</span>
    <b>console.log(dumpObject(&quot;navigator&quot;, navigator))</b> 
    <b>console.log(dumpObject(&quot;screen&quot;, screen))</b>  
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
@media only screen and (max-device-width: 480px) { 
body {
    font-size: 400%;
}
}

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:whenClicked()&quot;&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;    
</pre>

<p>Notes on the highlighted lines above:

<p><span class="num-marker">1</span> - 
This line sets the base URL for the debug agent, used by the code in the
<tt>remwi-*.js</tt> files.
    
<p><span class="num-marker">2</span> -
Mobile Safari doesn't include the <tt>JSON</tt> object!  And my code
makes use of JSON, so I pulled in Crockford's version.

<p><span class="num-marker">3</span> - 
These contain the code which provides the linkages to the debug agent;
the <tt>remwi-common.js</tt> file contains code used by both the
debug target (this file) and the debug client.

<p><span class="num-marker">4</span> -
The lines make calls to the standard <tt>console.log()</tt> function, which in this
case is overridden by the <tt>remwi-target.js</tt> file.

<h3>Debug client</h3>

<p>The debug client is literally the Web Inspector code as shipped with
WebKit nightlies, with some additional scripts added to override bits of 
functionality here and there.

<p>Because Web Inspector needs to support Chrome's multi-process architecture,
it turns out that a lot of the interaction between the debug client and the
target has been spec'd out as a set of functional interfaces.  Which makes
an effort like this a lot easier.

<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>What else can we conceivably do?</h2>

<p>Since we've got the Web Inspector code running, kind of,
it's easy to look at the function it provides and wonder about
how we could get that to work with this technique.  Let's go
panel-by-panel:

<ul>
    
<li><p><b>Elements</b>
<p>I'm unfamiliar with how this pane is populated by Web Inspector today;
it may be too slow to rely on the existing JavaScript engine to gather all
the information for this pane.  But that would be true for big web apps,
maybe it would be ok to do this in user-space for smaller apps, like something
running on a mobile device.

<li><p><b>Resources</b>
<p>Resources are a bit of a problem, since JavaScript generally has no
knowledge of other resources being loaded.  This can be solved by 
proxying your entire app through the debug agent.  Then the debug
agent can capture which resources are being accessed, when they were
loaded, how long it took to load them, etc.  The proxy could be a simple
proxy for a specific app, so you would always debug your app by
targetting the debug agent as the opening page, or could be a general 
HTTP proxy set up at the device level.
    
<li><p><b>Storage</b>
<p>At least some bits of the Storage pane seem possible to implement,
but will require overriding the existing APIs.  For instance, for the
SQL databases, there's no API to determine the name of the databases
being used.  The existing APIs could be wrappered so that you could
at least get the names of the databases your code is accessing.
    
<li><p><b>Console</b>
<p>The first bit of Console is already proven here.  The 
REPL needs to be added.  The console also catches messages
from WebKit that users don't typically see and aren't 
available via any existing JavaScript API.  Eventually, will
be nice to have these also.
    
</ul>

<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>What <b>can't</b> we do?</h2>

<p>Here's the panel-by-panel breakdown of what we can't easily
do with this technique:

<ul>
    
<li><p><b>Scripts</b> 
<p>This is the JavaScript source-level debugging pane, where you can
set breakpoints, etc in your JavaScript source.  Supporting this will
be impossible with the user-land debug story, as JavaScript debug
APIs aren't available to web applications.  Actually, there aren't any
debug APIs at all for JavaScriptCore.
    
<li><p><b>Timeline</b>
<p>Timeline provides low-level eventing information, for example,
when painting events occur.  Since this level of information isn't
available to user-land JavaScript, we'd need some new public APIs
for this.
    
<p>But see below for thoughts on instrumenting existing libraries to
generate some Timeline-ish information.
    
<li><p><b>Profiles</b>
    
<p>Profiling JavaScript code seems right out, with user-land code,
but see below for thoughts on instrumenting code to generate
data for the Profiles panel.
    
</ul>

<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>Other ideas</h2>

<h3>APIs for source-level JavaScript debug</h3>

<p>The lack of source-level JavaScript debug (see above) is 
very sad, especially since both FireBug and Web Inspector
provide pretty good capabilities there.  In my mind, 
these sort of APIs need to be made available, so that
we can write source-level debuggers in JavaScript.  Presumably
standardized as part of ECMAScript.

<p>In case you're wondering how you would write a source-level debugger
for JavaScript in JavaScript:

<ul>
<li>see Smalltalk
<li>probably involves <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/">Workers</a>
</ul>

<h3>Function/Class/Module-level debugging for JavaScript</h3>

<p>Source-level debugging for JavaScript is hard without real
APIs, but you can do some interesting things if you know about
the structure of your code.  For instance, see
<a href="http://pmuellr.blogspot.com/2009/12/who-called-that-function.html">"who called that function?"</a>
and
<a href="http://pmuellr.blogspot.com/2009/09/javascript-tracing.html">"JavaScript tracing"</a>.

<p>So while you might not be able to step through lines of a function, you
could probably have breakpoints just before a function is called, and just
after it returns (or throws an exception).  Might be good enough.

<p>You could also perhaps generate some information that could be used by
the Profiles pane.

<p>It's not a stretch to imagine library-specific extensions for debuggers; 
libraries/frameworks like
<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>,
<a href="http://code.google.com/closure/library/docs/overview.html">Closure</a>, and
<a href="http://commonjs.org/">CommonJS</a>
seem like they'd be amenable, technically, to being instrumented to provide
information to the debugger.  They could, for instance, provide the list of
class/modules loaded, the relationships between the classes/modules, the contents
of them, etc.

<p>Many of these libraries also provide various eventing capabilities, which
could also be instrumented to provide information like the Timeline panel does.

<!-- ====================================================== -->
<h2>End goal</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, you don't want to have to run something like the
debug agent I've written, nor do you want to have Web Inspector running
as a web page, since it already runs fine within WebKit-enabled browsers.
The debug agent needs to be embedded into WebKit, and the current Web Inspector
needs to become able to connect to (or accept connections from) a remote
browser.

<p>One thing I'm thinking of doing is rewriting the debug agent using
<a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>.  If we have to add more code
to WebKit, then I'd like for it to be JavaScript code instead of C++ code,
so that would be a step in the right direction.

<p>Presumably, if this is all in WebKit, all of the panels, including
the Scripts panel, can be supported, for any debug targets that include
the relevant support.
