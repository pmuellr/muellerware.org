<p>I read this book after
starting Malcolm Gladwell's 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624">"Tipping Point"</a>.
I realized I wanted to know a little more about <i>persuasion</i>, and
Cialdini's book seem to have good reviews, and more importantly,
was available at my local library.</p>

<p>The book is similiar to Gladwell's in terms of talking about an
interesting topic that affects us all, and describing experiments
and their results to back the thesis of the argument.  Specially, 
the experiments are psychological, and those are always fun and
interesting.</p>

<p>I thought it would be useful to summarize the book's main points
here, for future reference.  Each section below maps to a chapter in
the book.</p>

<p>I highly recommend the book.  It's really a fun read, and will
shine some light on how we are duped by people all the time.
And how to counter that duping.  And maybe do some duping ourselves.
&nbsp;:-)&nbsp;  
The experimental results are interesting, and the real life
examples are things we can all relate to.  I didn't agree with
all of the analysis, but that's beyond the point.  I'm not
interested in <b>why</b> we do what we do so much, as the
fact that we <b>do it in the first place</b>.  </p>

<h2>Spoiler Alert</h2>

<p>Book summary follows.  

</p>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h2>Quick Summary of Principals</h2>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3>Reciprocation: The Old Give and Take .. and Take</h3>

<p>If you give people something, they will feel obligated to
give you something back, just to be polite.  Another twist on
this is to ask for something big, that you know that someone
won't give to you, and then come back with a smaller request.
You just 'gave' them something ... they will be more likely
to comply with the smaller request.  People do not like to be
in debt to other people, and will expend more than the debt
is worth to remove the debt.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3>Commitment and Consistency: Hobgoblins of the Mind</h3>

<p>People like to maintain the status quo.  Start by getting
someone you wish to persuade to accept something small. 
Over time, they will want to remain consistent and you can
persuade them on larger topics.  Another twist is that if it
costs you some pain to get something, you'll value it more
than if it didn't cost you some pain
</p>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3>Social Proof: Truths are Us</h3>

<p>We are all sheep; we'll follow the crowd.</p>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3>Liking: The Friendly Thief</h3>

<p>Being nice earns it's rewards.  This includes
physical attractiveness, being similiar to the persuadee,
giving compliments.  Good cop / bad cop is a twist on
this.  Also beware of "shoot the messenger"; it works
in reverse as well.</p>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3>Authority: Directed Deference</h3>

<p>People are more easily persuaded by those who are authorities
or appear to be so.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3>Scarcity: The Rule of the Few</h3>

<p>People see more value in objects if they think there
aren't many of them, or that the may be hard to get
later.</p>
