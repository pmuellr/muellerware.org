<p>notes:
    
<ul>
<li>the vitamin d # was prescribed to be 1000mcg 4x daily, which doesn't seem to
make any sense at all.  Someone had set him up for 25mcg 1x daily, which seems
to be more reasonable, according to the 
<a href="http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamind.asp">NIH site on vitamin d</a>.
</ul>

<p>notes:
    
<ul>
<li>he's only had tylenol once, and it was 2x 500mg in the afternoon
<li>provigil a few times, to try to combat morning groginess, but didn't seem to help
<li>ambien rarely - loses strength when it kicks in
<li>vicodin rarely - slows down when it kicks in
</ul>
