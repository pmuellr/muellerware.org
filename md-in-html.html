# using Markdown in html files

(tl;dr - "view source")

Here's a little cheat that let's you use Markdown as the source language
in your .html files.

Basic ideas:

* At the top, include whatever sort of HTML you'd put in your `<head>` element.

* Include jquery from a CDN

* Include showdown (whichever one, attacklab-API-compatible)

* Include the bit that will convert your markdown to HTML (see below)

* As the last thing at the top, but before your Markdown text, include an
open-ended `<style type="markdown">` element - it does not need to be 
closed at the end of the file.

Using `<style>` to contain the markup means the browser won't try to 
interpret anything that looks like html, which it will for other
elements.  `<script>` works the same way (does not interpret the 
text), but doesn't work as well for me in text editors, in terms of 
syntax highlighting.

Extra code to add to your document:

    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("style[type='markdown']").each(function() {
            var htmlText = new Showdown.converter().makeHtml($(this).text())
         
        $("body").append(htmlText)
        })
    })
